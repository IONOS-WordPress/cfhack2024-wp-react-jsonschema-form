# Purpose

This package implements a custom [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form) renderer outputting pure HTML5.

This renderer should be used for example use cases where the JSON Schema gets be rendered in published pages.

_Because it's probably very simple source code it could even be used as template for the [react-jsonschema-form-gutenberg renderer](../react-jsonschema-form-gutenberg/)._

It would be perfect if this package would:

- export the renderer via `src/index.js`

  Have a look at other renderers and how they do it : https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form/tree/main/packages

- provides a PHP file to register the renderer in WordPress using WordPress function [wp_register_script()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_register_script/)

- has a 'usage' section this this `README.md` file explaining how to use your renderer

## Future directions

- because The HTML5 renderer is intended to target published pages it would be a ideal choice the share the same runtime as the [WordPress Interactivity API](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/) which is also targeting published pages.

  - [WordPress Interactivity API](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/) is using [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) combined with [Preact Signals](https://github.com/preactjs/signals) as building blocks.

  Fortunately [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) is actually kinda _lightweight React_ (including [JSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSX_(JavaScript))) so it should be possible to implements our HTML5 renderer without making published pages too heavy.

- WordPress 6.5 allow plugin dependencies so we could also provide this package as plugin to register this renderer and as dependency for other plugins/themes.

  In memory of the late Alex Mills and Alex King, an 11-year-old [feature request for a plugin dependency system](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22316) was closed as **fixed**.Â 

  _Yes, you read that right: WordPress 6.5 will handle plugin dependencies._

  [This change](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/57545) lets you set a `Requires Plugins` header in your plugin with a list of plugin slugs that are necessary for your plugin to work. Perhaps it will also reopen the door for framework-like plugins in the directory, which have been [disallowed since 2016](https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2016/03/01/please-do-not-submit-frameworks/).

  *Contra : We cannot use this effort for the theme since themes doesn't support a plugin dependency header yet.*

# Development

## Tips

### Make yourself a priorization list what tasks to implement first

We probably don't need __all__ renderer functions for our show cases.

Ask your team mates which form elements they need first (notably text inputs and stuff) and implement them as first.

### Remember that the HTML5 renderer output will usually targeting published pages.

- keep the output _simple_ and _tiny_ HTML5

  - should ideally look well on mobile devices and desktop

- should be standards based - don't use quirky HTML hacks

- think twice before adding a custom CSS rule - the CSS for the HTML5 renderer output should work well with as many themes as possible

  - I would suggest to use the latest official WordPress theme ([Twenty Twenty-Four](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty-four/)) to test with since it looks exceptional good.

### If I would be you ...

I would start creating a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) story for each of the features you want to implement.

Kinda **SDD** - **S**tory **D**riven **D**evelopment ðŸ’¡ !

Using Storybook you can easily develop and test your components in isolation. Have the story opened in the browser and every ime you save the file it gets updated within storybook.

### How to start

I would simply *copy* the cheapest available renderer into this package and start transforming it little by little using plain HTML5.
