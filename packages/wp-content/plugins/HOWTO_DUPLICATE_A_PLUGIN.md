It might be useful to duplicate one of the plugins as a personal playground for testing and learning. This is a step by step guide to duplicate a plugin.

Let's take the `jsonschema-plugin-settings-page` plugin as example :

- Copy the `jsonschema-plugin-settings-page` plugin beside the existing plugin into `packages/wp-content/plugins/`

- Rename the folder to `jsonschema-plugin-settings-page-duplicate`

-

_Duplicating the `react-jsonschema-form-renderer` plugin and `theme-extending-global-styles-jsonschema` theme needs a little bit more attention. Please consult me (Lars) if you are planning to do this._
